# Profile-Creator
Is a program used for creating a full account data template for most websites. This is useful for testing websites and scripts for errors. You can use this to create a bot and send data to your database or system.

Introduction
This program was originally written by me and used when I wanted to get past a certain censorships that needed accounts. 


This can also admitly be used for nafarious purposes but I do not condone or support them. 

What problem does this solve?
- Can be used as placeholder data in a database
- Can be used to avoid form filling with real info to make accounts

Features:
* Uses common python modules to create fake information.
* Creates strong passwords based upon random words.
* Common information created for use for creating accounts.

This tool can be used to make a fake identity for creating profiles online and stuff. It uses a module in python called Faker and uses this module to generate fake information.
